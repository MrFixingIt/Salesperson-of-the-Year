1. Who was the top salesperson for the year?
The top salesperson for the year was Abraham Bennet at over $22,630,081 woth of sales. Reginald Blotchet-Halls holds 2nd place at $4,889,656.

2. How much better did the top salesperson do than the individual who came in second for the year?
Abraham Bennet was able to out sell Reginald Blotchet-Halls by $17,740,425.

3. Was there any relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales?
There was no relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales that I could see.

4. How do you think the top selling salesperson gained so many sales? What was their strategy?
From what I can see, it would appear that he was able to sell large quantities of each item he sold, his customer base consists of a dedicated few and he also has some big ticket items as well.

5. What was the top selling product for the year? What was the lowest selling? (For both dollar amount sold and quantity sold).
"Road-350-W Yellow" sold the most at 983 units and "Adjustable Race" sold the least at only 10 units.
"Mountain-100 Silver" sold for the most at $3,399.99 and "Chainring Bolts" were offered to our customers free of charge.

6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
I thought it was odd that we didn't charge for "Chainring Bolts". We could have at least offered them at a low price as a two pack or 10 pack perhaps.
